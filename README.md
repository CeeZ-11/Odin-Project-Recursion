# Odin-Project-Recursion
This project explores recursion with two tasks: generating the Fibonacci sequence using both iterative and recursive methods, and implementing a recursive merge sort to sort arrays. These exercises help build a strong understanding of recursion, iteration, and basic algorithmic problem-solving techniques.
